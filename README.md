### Game
Our plan is to make a game where the player owns a pet that gets stronger as he's taken care of. Using RFID tecnology our goal is to make battles between two pets possible scanning a tag that is attached to each console.
To make the pet stronger the player will have to play some mini-games. Two of them are:

#### Food mini-game
In this game food drops from the top of the screen and the player controls the pet in order for him to eat.

#### Matching mini-game
After being prompted various keys, the player must hit them in the exact same order as they showed, so as to get the maximum score possible.
