# Project

Our goal is to create an arduino-powered mini console that plays a virtual pet game, also developed by the team.
In this current phase of development we have established the following thematics:
- PCB main board developed by the team, to give the console a shape and to connect the following components:

	- Arduino Nano;
	- 0.96" OLED screen;
	- 6 buttons;
	- Buzzer;
	- TP4056 micro-usb lithium battery charging module;
	- 90mAh LiPo battery;
	- RC-522 RFID module;


- Develop the pet's statistics by doing either idle actions or interacting with the pet through minigames;

	- Feeding minigame, where the player has to control his pet to catch food falling from the top of the screen;
	- Exercise minigame, where the player has to hit a sequence of keys presented to him, in it's exact order;
	- Adventure minigame, where the pet goes on an adventure and the console is set idle, until the pet comes back;

- RFID implementation (sensor and tag) to randomize events or let players fight which eachother's pets;

The concepts presented here are still rough ideas, they can and will be changed in the future, to match the team's ideas.
