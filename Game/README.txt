The 'Arduino' folder contains the libraries used in the game development with our changes made.
The 'game' folder contains the main game files:
	- 'game.ino' is the main code with the game mechanics.
	- The file 'sprites.c' has all the graphics used in the game in 'bitmap' format.
	- The python file 'arduboy_screen.py' is used to mirror the game to a computer screen. This was mostly used to take screenshots.
